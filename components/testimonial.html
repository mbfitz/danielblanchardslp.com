                                It was an honor to work with Imarc. They demonstrated, very early on, a true ability to understand our business and solve for our needs—create a new intranet site, one that would increase engagement and foster community. Imarc delivered incredible results, taking our former site to new heights. We couldn’t be happier with their work and subject matter expertise.

                                To use the TESTIMONIAL WITH ASSET component, you simply need to add a div.asset on the same level as the blockquote and include your image within.
