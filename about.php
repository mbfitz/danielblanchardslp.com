                    Daniel’s journey to becoming a speech and language pathologist began in the Dominican Republic, where he worked in an orphanage during a college internship. Inspired by the strengths of disadvantaged children, he knew he wanted to devote his life to improving their outcomes. After finishing his undergraduate degree with additional coursework in Chile to gain fluency in Spanish, Daniel began studying speech and language pathology. He entered the profession in 2007 as a monolingual therapist and was certified as a bilingual therapist in 2009.

                    Today, Daniel works in a school and has a thriving private practice. His clients range from pre-school through adolescence, and many have neurodevelopmental difficulties, including Autism Spectrum Disorder. Outside of his work as a therapist, Daniel gives back to the clinical community and helps to develop the skills of Clinical Fellows as a Clinical Supervisor for the American Speech and Hearing Association.
