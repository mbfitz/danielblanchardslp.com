                            We met Daniel six years ago after a number of false starts with other speech and language pathologists. From the beginning, Daniel was friendly, very knowledgeable, and professional. He sets clear boundaries and has high expectations. My daughter knows that when Daniel comes, it's time to work – and she does, even when she is not in the mood!

                            When you discover that your child has special needs, a bevy of practitioners and experts suddenly become a part of your everyday life, some for a few weeks and others for a year or two. We feel very lucky that, through all of the changes, Daniel has been a consistent witness to our daughter's growth, as well as a skilled therapist who has challenged her and fostered her growth at every stage.

                            When my daughter Sabrina was diagnosed with autism at age two, we had to start the process of putting together a team of therapists. Daniel was Sabrina’s first speech language pathologist. We liked him right away, and Sabrina did too. We thought we were lucky to have found someone so wonderful – now we KNOW we are lucky to have Daniel
                            !</p>

                            Sabrina has had many speech and language pathologists over the past several years, so I can say with confidence that Daniel is exceptional in what he does. He is kind, patient, and gentle, and unbelievably devoted to his clients while maintaining the highest decorum of professionalism. He is on board to participate on any team and sharing of information when it comes to helping with Sabrina’s development. This willingness to work with the other therapists is crucial and has contributed greatly to Sabrina’s developmental progress, a progress that continues today in a large part because of Daniel’s input.

                        <p>
                            Any time I am asked for a speech and language pathologist recommendation, I give Daniel’s name without hesitation. Should they be fortunate enough to work with Daniel, they are always incredibly grateful – as we are that he remains a part of Sabrina’s team of therapists to this day, and hopefully well into the future.

                            If recommendations had subject headings, this one for Daniel would have to be, “When wow does not suffice....” I am the parent of a 21-year-old son with autism who has been working with assorted home therapists for 18 years. Jed had multiple oral motor issues as well as hypotonia and speech delays, and working with Daniel, he has made more progress than I thought possible. Daniel was a regular part of my son’s weekly schedule for more than five years, and “work with Daniel” became something Jed looked forward to. And in a world where schedule is almost everything, I knew if Daniel said he was coming, then he'd be there. Daniel is highly skilled, creative, and imaginative when engaging with a client, as well as completely reliable and worthy of being trusted with your child. I trusted him with mine in my home and in the community, and Jed and I are both better off for it.
